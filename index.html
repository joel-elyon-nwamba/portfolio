        <p>Our Movie Review and Watchlist Application is a web-based platform developed using Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Node, EJS, and JavaScript. It provides users with the ability to sign in with their google account, save their data, maintain a watchlist, and contribute custom movie information.</p>

        <a href="https://joel-elyon-nwamba.github.io/simon-game/" target="_blank"><h3>Simon Game</h3></a>
        <p>The Simon Game is a classic memory-based game that challenges players to recall and repeat an ever-growing sequence of colors and sounds. I built this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on user interaction, DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic. It was a great way to reinforce my understanding of event-driven programming and state management in vanilla JavaScript.
          <br>
          Technologies Used:
HTML5: To structure the game interface

CSS3: For styling the game layout and animations

JavaScript (Vanilla): For game logic, user input handling, and UI updates

        <p>Overview:

The Book Library App is a web-based application that allows users to add, view, and manage a list of books they want to read. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app lets users input details for each book — such as the title, author, number of pages, and whether it's been read — and dynamically updates the display with options to toggle read status or remove books. This project sharpened my understanding of object-oriented programming, DOM manipulation, and event-driven design in vanilla JavaScript.</p>
